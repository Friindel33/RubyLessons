Dear Customers,
The impact of the COVID-19 virus is having a massive impact on all of our lives and livelihoods.
Based on the latest instructions issued by UK Government we are having to amend our ways of working to ensure we can fully comply with the social distancing advice.
Any orders placed during the current period may be subject to a delay of 1-2 days.
We apologise for the inconvenience but it is vitally important to us all that we can take the necessary precautions.
We value your ongoing cooperation during this period and look forward to better times in the coming months.
